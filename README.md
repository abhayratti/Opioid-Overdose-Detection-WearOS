# Opioid-Overdose-Detection App ü©∫

After doing a problem analysis on the opioid overdose epidemic in North America, we discovered that close to 1 in every 5 deaths would be preventable by having premptive OD detection through a smartwatch.

Hence, we started building an overdose detection app that uses vitals data like heart rate and respiratory rate to predict overdoses in advance, calling EMS and saving lives ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π.

For a full understanding of what we're building and the problem/technical breakdown, check out our memo:
